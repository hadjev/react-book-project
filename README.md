# SoftUni React Project

This is my Book Library project.

-   To run the project you have to install **MongoDB locally**.
-   To get started, please go to `./server/run-first` and run the `populate.js` file. This creates a collection named 'books' with 45 documents in your DB.
-   **Install** the npm packages for the `client` and the `server`
-   **Start** the `client` and the `server`
